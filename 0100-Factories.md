## Factories
A factory next to another factory gets +6 metal/turn (+20%), and a factory next to two other factories will get +10 metal/turn (+33%).

However, mineral terraforms are pretty rare, so you can replace this with 2 depots and 4 depots, respectively.

I would argue (and so does one of the loading screen tips) that this is the most important thing to do - a couple depots cost 30 metal (22 if one of them is placed over an existing tunnel) and will pay themselves off in 4-5 turns.

And increasing the factory level doesn't even make the deposit run out faster - it's just free stuff.

## Refineries
Same thing as with factories, but proportionally smaller bonus - +3 (+20%) and +5 (+33%), respectively.
